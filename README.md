# ts-projects-codecademy

This repo holds the source code from completing the Codecademy [Learn TypeScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript) course projects.

## Topics Covered

- Types
- Functions
- Complex Types
- Union Types
- Type Narrowing
- Advanced Object Types

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- TypeScript compiler (tsc)

### Running the Apps

To run these TypeScript apps locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bsh
   git clone https://github.com/arsy786/ts-projects-codecademy.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific project directory that contains the `.ts` file you want to run:

   ```bash
   cd ts-projects-codecademy/path/to/project
   ```

3. Compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   tsc
   ```

   This command will compile the TypeScript file(s) (`*.ts`) in the current directory to JavaScript files (`*.js`), based on the `tsconfig.json` configuration found in the same directory.

4. Once the compilation is successful, you can run the JavaScript files using Node.js. For example:

   ```bash
   node <filename.js>
   ```

   Replace <filename.js> with the name of the JavaScript file that was generated from the TypeScript compilation.

This setup allows you to run the JS files in the terminal and view the output directly.
